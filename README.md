This demonstrates a JS implementation of the color_tiles functionality from the R [formattable](https://github.com/renkun-ken/formattable/) package. The JS implementation preserves data type information, so that the filter functionality in DataTables works properly.

(The included rainbow JS library comes from https://github.com/anomal/RainbowVis-JS)
